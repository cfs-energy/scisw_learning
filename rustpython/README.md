# Rust-Python Hybrid Projects

The Rust ecosystem provides exceptional support for generating and distributing Python bindings.

A production-grade Python library with bindings over a simple Rust API can be produced in
under 2 hours, after which adding new functionality takes about 10-20 minutes per function.

## Syllabus

This class is taught in a single one-hour session, and assumes basic familiarity with
both the Python and Rust programming languages.

* Project initialization
* Updates for ability to publish as both a Rust crate and a Python library
* Implementation of an example data-parallelism function in Rust w/ python bindings
